# Homework: Create a madlib. Imagine a story where some of the words are 
# supplied by user input. Using python you will use input to collect 
# words for a story and then display the story. 

# Use input to collect each word to a variable
# Use an f string to display the story

# Your madlib must collect at least 6 words!

# print(f"My {noun} wore {color} shoes while they counted to {num}")

# print(f"{name} wore {color} shoes while they counted to {num}")


print("Welcome to todays Madlib!")

movie_name = input("Please enter a movie name: ")
first_adjective = input("Please enter an adjective: ")
second_adjective = input("Please enter an adjective: ")
number = input("Please enter a number: ")
verb = input("Please enter a verb: ")
second_verb = input("Please enter a verb: ")

print(f" My favorite movie in the world is {movie_name}. It's so {first_adjective} and {second_adjective}. I watch it about {number} times a year. The funnest part is when they are {verb} and {second_verb}.")

#My favorite movie in the world is __movie name__. It's so _addjective___ and _adjective__. I rewatch about _number___ times a yea. 
#The funnest part is when they are_ verb_ and __verb_.
